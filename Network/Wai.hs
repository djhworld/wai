This module defines a generic web application interface. It is a common
protocol between web servers and web applications.

The overriding design principles here are performance, generality and type
safety. To address performance, this library is built on 'Enumerator's for the
request and response bodies. The advantages of this approach over lazy IO has
been debated elsewhere.

Nonetheless, many people find 'Enumerator's difficult to work with. For that
reason, this library includes the "Network.Wai.Enumerator" module to provide
more familiar abstractions, including lazy IO.

Generality is achieved by removing many variables commonly found in similar
projects that are not universal to all servers. The goal is that the 'Request'
object contains only data which is meaningful in all circumstances.

Unlike other approaches, this package declares many data types to assist in
type safety. This feels more in the general Haskell spirit.

A final note: please remember when using this package that, while your
application my compile without a hitch against many different servers, there
are other considerations to be taken when moving to a new backend. For example,
if you transfer from a CGI application to a FastCGI one, you might suddenly
find you have a memory leak. Conversely, a FastCGI application would be
well served to preload all templates from disk when first starting; this
would kill the performance of a CGI application.

-- | An enumerator is a data producer. It takes two arguments: a function to
-- enumerate over (the iteratee) and an accumulating parameter. As the
-- enumerator produces output, it calls the iteratee, thereby avoiding the need
-- to allocate large amounts of memory for storing the entire piece of data.
--
-- Normally in Haskell, we can achieve the same results with laziness. For
-- example, an inifinite list does not require inifinite memory storage; we
-- simply get away with thunks. However, when operating in the IO monad, we do
-- not have this luxury. There are other approaches, such as lazy I\/O. If you
-- would like to program in this manner, please see
-- "Network.Wai.Enumerator", in particular toLBS.
--
-- That said, let's address the details of this particular enumerator
-- implementation. You'll notice that the iteratee is a function that takes two
-- arguments and returns an 'Either' value. The second argument is simply the
-- piece of data generated by the enumerator. The 'Either' value at the end is
-- a means to alert the enumerator whether to continue or not. If it returns
-- 'Left', then the enumeration should cease. If it returns 'Right', it should
-- continue.
--
-- The accumulating parameter (a) has meaning only to the iteratee; the
-- enumerator simply passes it around. The enumerator itself also returns an
-- 'Either' value; a 'Right' means the enumerator ran to completion, while a
-- 'Left' indicates early termination was requested by the iteratee.
--
-- 'Enumerator's are used twice in the WAI: once in the 'Request' datatype to
-- access the request body, and once in the 'Response' datatype for the
-- application to return the body of the response.
--
-- 'Enumerator's are not required to be resumable. That is to say, the
-- 'Enumerator' may only be called once. While this requirement puts a bit of a
-- strain on the caller in some situations, it saves a large amount of
-- complication- and thus performance- on the producer.
